host
the

refuses
to
call
the
baby
formula
shortage
a
crisis
i
know
quite
a
few
parents
who
disagree
the
lead
starts
right
now
baby

under
lock
and
key
in
some
spots
impossible
to
find
in
others
how
the
biden
administration
is
now
responding
after
shortages
that
have
been
here
for
months
plus
russia
retaliating
the

cut
its

hello
and
welcome
to

jake
tapper
if
you're
the
parent
of
an
infant
and
you
rely
on
formula
for
your
baby's
nutrition
and
survival
well
empty
store
shelves
have
become
a
frustratingly
familiar
sight
this
is
in
minnesota
today
but
it
is
happening
all
over
the
country
slim
pickings
at
a
walmart
outside
dallas
also
today
few
choices
at
a
pharmacy
in
atlanta
just
a
few
hours
ago
and
this
afternoon
in
alexandria
virginia
literally
across
the
river
from
where
lawmakers
are
currently
wringing
their
hands
and
making
speeches
about
the
shortage
nothing
what's
left
in
stock
that's
actually
formulated
for
toddlers
not
for
infants
parents
from
coast
to
coast
panic
texting
their
relatives
asking
them
to
check
stores
in
their
neighborhoods
what's
that
no
luck
they
go
to
the
local
parent
facebook
group
pleading
for
help
along
with
every
other
parent
in
the
facebook
group
it
may
only
be
grabbing
national
headlines
now
but
parents
of
infants
have
had
trouble
finding
food
for
their
babies
for
months
and
many
are
at
their
wit's
end
a
february
recall
and
subsequent
shutdown
of
a
factory
making
some
of
the
most
in
demand
formulas
exacerbated
what
was
already
a
stressed
supply
chain
and
now
43
percent
of
formula
43
percent
out
of
stock
across
the
country
on
average
the
biden
administration
and
washington
lawmakers
are
struggling
to
answer
the
questions
and
fears
of
families
across
the
country
the
president
himself
saying
moments

if
only
we

coming

joe
biden

of

if
we
had
been
better
mind
readers
i
guess
we
could
have
but
we
moved
as
quickly
as
the
problem
became
apparent
to
us
and
we
have
to
move
with
caution
as
well
as
speed
because
we
got
to
make
sure
what
we're
getting
is
in
fact
first
rate
product
that's
why
the
fda
has
to
go
through
the
process

that
is
cold
comfort
to
all
those
parents
still
unable
to
find
what
their
babies
need
as
cnn's
mj
lee
reports
for
us
critics
say
the

was
caught
flat
footed
by
the

we're

across
the

ratcheting
up
the
pressure
on
the
federal
government
psaki
so
we're
working
on
every
lever
to
expedite
addressing
this
and
to
insure
that
when
people
go
when
mothers
go
to
the
grocery

in
coming
weeks
that
they
will
see
the
shelves
stocked
lee
the
president
convening
a
call
with
manufacturers
and
retailers
this
week
to
discuss
ways
to
boost
production
biden
i
spent
a
couple
hours
on
the
phone
lee
the
administration
also
announcing
other
initiatives
like
cracking
down
on
price
gouging
and
importing
more
baby
formula
from
abroad
cnn
also
learning
the
white
house
is
strongly
considering
invoking
the
defense
production
act
to
try
to
ease
the
pressure
though
it's
seen
as
a
longer
term
not
an
immediate
solution
psaki
the
production
of
baby
formula
is
so
specialized
and
so
specific
that
you
can't
just
use
the
defense
production
act
to
say
to
a
company
that
produces
something
else
produce
baby
formula
it
just
doesn't
work
that
way
lee
and
one
major
problem
is
getting
in
the
way
of
faster
progress
according
to
the
white
house
hoarding
psaki
what
we
are
seeing
which
is
enormous
problem
is
hoarding
people
hoarding
because
they're
fearful
that
is
one
element
of
it
and
people
hoarding
because
they're
trying
to
profit
off
fearful
parents
lee
even
as
it
confronts
questions
and
criticism
about
whether
it
waited
too
long
to
act
and
hasn't
been
aggressive
enough
the
white
house
declining
to
call
the
nationwide
formula
shortage
a
crisis
bedingfield
well
i
don't
think
it's
about
a
label
i
think
it's
about
addressing
directly
the
need
that
families
all
across
the
country
have
lee
and
also
reticent
to
publicly
predict
when
the
shortage
will
end
bedingfield
we're
working
to
move
as
quickly
as
possible
that
is
the
candid
honest
answer
end
videotape
lee
on
camera
now
when
cnn
asked
the
white
house
yesterday
whether
there
is
federal
guidance
for
parents
who
can't
find
baby
formula
in
stores
we
didn't
get
a
good
answer
from
the
white
house

but
just
moments
ago
the
white
house
announcing
there
is
now
a
new
website
that
is
hhs.gov
formula
that
has
some
basic
information
on
what
parents
can
do
but
jake
i
think
it
is
so
important
to
emphasize
the
reason
that
there
is
such
intense
panic
and
desperation
with
parents
is
because
there
is
no
good
substitute
for
formula
or
breast
milk
this
is
why
we're
seeing
some
parents
across
the
country
asking
questions
like
is
it
safe
to
make
formula
at
home
is
it
safe
to
dilute
formula
and
the
answer
is
no
to
both
of
those
questions

thank
you
so
much
cnn's
senior
medical

elizabeth
cohen
joins
us
live
elizabeth
stores
across
the
country
have
had
a
hard
time
keeping
formula
in
stock
for
months
how
bad
is
the
crisis
how
fast
can
it
be
fixed
elizabeth
cohen
cnn
senior
medical
correspondent
jake
it
is
bad
we're
talking
to
parents
who
are
in
tears
searching
for
formula
for
their
babies
let's
take
a
look
at
these
numbers
as
you
mentioned
43
percent
out
of
stock
rate
across
the
country
according
to
datasembly
if
you
look
at
these
eight
cities
and
these
metro
yare
as
if
we
look
at
the
week
ending
may
8th
it
was
50
percent
more
than
half
of
the
formula
that
should
have
been
there
was
actually
there
now
this
is
not
going
to
be
solved
quickly
it's
going
to
be
abbott's
plant
in
michigan
that
got
closed
down
it's
going
to
be
at
least
six
to
eight
weeks
until
they
can
reopen
and
start
making
product
again
but
let's
talk
about
what
abbott
and
the
white
house
say
that
they're
doing
to
help
alleviate
this
abbott
has
air
shipped
millions
of
cans
of
formula
from
its
plant
in
ireland
and
it's
also
switching
manufacturing
lines
from
other
products
to
formula
to
prioritize
formula
and
the
white
house
says
that
they're
working
to
increase
u.s
manufacturing
and
importing
but
again
parents
should
know
that
we're
talking
at
least
weeks
here
and
maybe
even
longer
until
this
gets
solved
jake
tapper
how
can
parents
cope
safely
with
the
shortage
if
they're
running
low
on
formula
what
are
they
supposed
to
do
cohen
this
is
really
tough
and
i'm
going
to
give
you
more
do
nots
than
dos
but
let
me
give
you
a
couple
do
nots
because
this
is
really
important
and
mj
mentioned
this
as
well
do
not
make
your
own
formula
at
home
there's
no
such
thing
as
diy
formula
you
have
to
get
the
right
blend
of
vitamins
and
minerals
and
proteins
and
sugars
or
you
could
really
hurt
your
baby
also
don't
give
your
baby
under
1
cow's
milk
or
soy
milk
or
anything
like
that
do
not
dilute
formula
your
baby
needs
those
calories
and
minerals
and
vitamins
and
do
talk
to
your
pediatrician
i'm
going
to
be
honest
here
your
pediatrician
doesn't
have
a
secret
stash
they
don't
known
some
target
or
walmart
that
you
don't
know
about
but
there
is
it
is
possible
that
if
your
baby
has
a
specific
medical
problem
and
needs
a
specific
formula
your
pediatrician
may
very
well
be
able
to
help
also
if
you're
a
mom
who
recently
stopped
breast
feeding
in
order
to
go
on
to
formula
to
transition
to
formula
your
pediatrician
can
introduce
you
to
a
lactation
counselor
who
may
be
able
to
help
you
get
that
breast
milk
supply
going
again
jake
tapper
all
right
elizabeth
cohen
thank
you
so
much
joining
us
now
live
to
discuss
is
democratic
congresswoman
pramila
jayapal
of
washington
state
she
serves
as
the
chair
of
the
congressional
progressive
caucus
congresswoman
thanks
for
joining
us
i
know
you
know
this
crisis
has
been
building
for
months
president
biden
moments
ago
said
quote
if
we
had
been
better
mind
readers
they
could
have
avoided
it
why
does
it
feel
like
the
biden
administration
is
only
now
starting
to
treat
this
like
the
huge
deal
so
many
parents
know
it
has
been
for
months
rep
pramila
jayapal
d
wa
well
jake
it's
good
to
see
you
i
think
there
are
many
threads
to
this
problem
and
we
have
to
kind
of
untwine
all
of
them
the
thing
that
really
struck
me
when
i
started
looking
into
this
issue
and
hearing
all
the
complaints
from
across
the
country
and
certainly
from
my
constituents
is
that
there
are
only
four
manufacturers
of
baby
food
formula
that
is
a
stunningly
small
number
and
it
just
shows
how
market
consolidation
has
made
it
so
that
then
those
four
manufacturers
are
providing
i
think
it's
98
percent
of
all
the
baby
food
and
in
fact
the
manufacturing
is
only
happening
in
one
plant
right
now
so
when
you
have
a
problem
with
a
plant
a
plant
shuts
down
and
you're
down
to
one
plant
and
just
a
couple
of
manufacturers
this
is
when
you
start
to
see
the
problems
of
consolidation
on
top
of
the
pandemic
secondly
the
wic
program
actually
has
rules
in
place
so
that
it's
only
one
or
two
of
those
formulas
that
is
actually
allowed
within
the
wic
program
the
wic
program
buys
about
50
percent
of
the
baby
food
formula
in
the
country
and
so
what
we're
going
to
do
next
week
and
the
president
just
announced
this
is
we're
going
to
bring
in
emergency
suspension
bill
to
the
floor
to
get
wic
to
be
able
to
relax
some
of
those
restrictions
and
be
able
to
get
more
of
the
different
manufacturers
formula
in
16
10
07
the
third
thing
is
even
though
you
see
those
numbers
and
it's
a
crisis
i
mean
i
fed
my
child
my
daughter
was
really
prematurely
born
so
i
only
could
rely
on
baby
food
formula
and
it
was
really
hard
we
were
in
india
at
the
time
getting
the
formula
is
like
life
and
death
for
a
parent
i
mean
for
a
child
and
for
a
parent
so
i
really
sympathize
with
this
part
of
the
challenge
is
it's
not
the
baby
food
formula
is
out
of
stock
everywhere
in
the
country
it's
out
of
stock
in
particular
states
because
the
shipments
aren't
being
processed
across
the
board
evenly
and
so
it
is
really
important
that
we
fix
all
of
these
things
we're
going
to
have
a
couple
hearings
on
consolidation
and
market
consolidation
we're
we
need
to
dive
in
to
the
fda
and
the
problems
with
the
fda
in
actually
finding
the
issues
with
that
plant
in
michigan
and
i
think
it
is
important
for
the
president
to
look
at
the
defense
production
act
and
other
ways
to
really
increase
the
supply
of
baby
food
formula
right
here
but
listen
if
you're
a
parent
i
know
you
know
if
you're
a
parent
this
is
a
crisis
and
i
sympathize
with
parents
across
the
country
dealing
with
this
tapper
this
is
hardly
the
first
time
that
there's
this
slow
rolling
anticipated
disaster
happening
exactly
as
forewarned
whether
it's
the
exit
from
afghanistan
the
border
surge
the
biden
administration
does
not
want
to
call
this
a
crisis
you
just
called
it
a
crisis
it's
a
crisis
right
jayapal
i
mean
i
think
if
you're
a
parent
that
can't
get
formula
for
your
kid
it's
a
crisis
i
think
that
i
was
trying
to
explain
all
the
different
factors
because
i
don't
think
it's
true
that
we
don't
we
can't
access
this
baby
formula
we
can
make
some
changes
we're
going
do
some
things
to
give
more
flexibility
to
the
wic
program
we'll
make
sure
that
we
get
supplies
across
the
board
and
we
do
have
to
invest
in
getting
more
manufacturers
producing
formula
but
i
will
just
say
there's
also
this
market
consolidation
you
know
jake
this
is
something
i
have
been
on
because
there
is
also
profiteering
we
had
a
briefing
this
morning
i
can't
go
into
detail
about
what
was
in
the
briefing
but
from
the
ftc
chair
lina
khan
and
we're
looking
at
what
are
the
ways
also
to
address
price
gouging
when
these
situations
occur
these
manufacturers
have
a
responsibility
to
make
sure
this
formula
is
available
accessible
and
is
not
being
you
know
the
prices
are
increased
across
the
board
just
for
profits
tapper
i
want
to
give
you
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
one
of
the
criticisms
we're
seeing
on
the
right
in
conservative
media
and
republican
politicians
focusing
on
images
from
the
border
that
show
there
is
formula
available
to
processing
centers
for
undocumented
immigrants
here's
fox
this
morning
begin
video
clip
unidentified
female
she
is
saying
that
they
are
giving
the
formula
all
of
these
palettes
of
formula
to
the
illegal
babies
on
the
border
meanwhile
so
many
american
families
can't
find
this
formula
on
the
shelves
in
their
stores
unidentified
male
what
terrible
optics
unidentified
male
look
anywhere
where
the
president's
crackdown
on
what's
happening
at
the
border
there's
no
sign
of
it
if
the
president
has
his
way
in
one
week
it's
going
to
quadruple
you
know
how
much
formula
we're
going
to
need
then
end
video
clip
tapper
not
exactly
the
algonquin
round
table
i
want
to
give
you
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
that
jayapal
well
i
found
it
disgusting
i
would
never
call
a
baby
illegal
and
this
apparently
from
the
party
that
says
they're
pro
life
pro
family
didn't
want
to
fund
the
child
tax
credit
so
that
millions
of
kids
could
come
out
of
poverty
don't
want
to
provide
child
care
don't
want
to
provide
paid
leave
family
leave
i
don't
need
to
be
lectured
by
people
who
won't
even
stand
up
for
the
children
that
are
right
here
and
then
use
a
crisis
like
this
to
again
do
what
they
have
always
done
demonize
immigrants
that
is
it's
just
ridiculous
again
the
reality
is
that
we
have
got
some
issues
we've
got
to
address
supply
chain
plus
market
consolidation
issues
and
we've
got
to
make
sure
that
we're
getting
this
formula
to
all
of
the
states
and
of
course
increasing
the
supplies
through
the
wic
program
because
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
is
black
brown
indigenous
and
poor
families
who
are
most
disproportionately
burdened
by
this
baby
formula
shortage
tapper
democratic

you

much
have

now
russia
is
claiming
this

the
timing
we
should
note
comes
just
one
day
after
finland
publicly
expressed
support
for
joining

which
russia
of
course
opposes

the

but
even
still
it's
a
shock
to
see
how
close
the
russians
got
on
the
other
side
of
this
road
we
are
told
this
is
from
de
mining
a
controlled
blast
yet
here
everything
is
fluid
ukraine
stopped
russia's
advance
here
on
the
first
day
of
the
war
killing
two
soldiers
by
this
armor
three
civilians
shot
dead
in
this
car
then
and
their
bodies
recovered
only
two
days
ago
you
can
see
the
colossal
force
used
here
a
tank
turret
literally
that
full
distance
thrown
off
the
tank
body
the
village
of
zarkony
ph
lies
ahead
liberated
days
earlier
people
are
starting
to
go
back
he
said
but
they
are
still
shelling
it
two
women
died
two
days
ago
when
they
walked
onto
a
trip
wire
trap
set
in
the
village
and
even
around
these
factories
special
forces
here
warn
that
a
soldier
was
wounded
by
a
booby
trap
three
days
ago
the
zed
markings
of
russia's
invasion
still
a
deranged
sign
of
their
collective
insanity
even
two
months
on
why
do
they
do
this
they
say
they
reclaimed
this
area
about
a
week
ago
but
they're
now
in
the
difficult
task
of
de
mining
what
they
can
but
look
around
here
there's
really
not
much
left
to
make
safe
these
civilians
evacuated
from
the
next
village
just
two
kilometers
away
it's
a
nightmare
she
says
the
shooting
is
heavy
the
driver
adds
and
we
let
them
race
on
desperation
takes
different
forms
here
and
caught
by
another
kind
of
survival
is
dmitri
whose
wife
moved
away
a
while
ago
wheeling
back
food
he's
got
for

i
haven't
really
left
my

for

he
said
i
crossed
the
fields
passed
the
bomb
fragments
to
get
the
food
his
gentle
stroll
in
the
open
a
sign
of
how
long
the
violence
has
swirled
here
not
that
it
is
slowing
end
videotape
tapper
now
we
understand
jake
tonight
as
in
the
night
before
that
zarkony
has
come
under
intense
shelling
that's
part
it
seems
of
the
russian
operands
here
that
they
retreat
shell
what
they
leave
behind
and
they
do
appear
to
be
forming
a
pattern
here
of
moving
back
towards
their
border
often
under
intense
duress
from
ukrainian
forces
and
you
mentioned
too
earlier
there
do
appear
to
be
signs
as
they're
trying
to
protect
the
vital
supply
line
to
the
east
of
where
this
retreat
is
occurring
that
runs
from
russia
right
down
to
izyum
where
the
bulk
of
their
forces
are
they
may
have
destroyed
some
bridges
to
increase
their
protection
there
but
a
lot
moving
back
and
forth
in
small
incremental
amounts
around
the
front
lines
here
and
in
the
east
in
the
center
of
the
country
and
also
in
the
south
predominantly
a
stalemate
though
the
u.s
secretary
of
defense
lloyd
austin
speaking
to
his
counterpart
in
russia
sergei
shoigu
just
today
to
keep
that
communication
line
open
the
rest
of
the
call
not
entirely
clear
but
interesting
it
occurs
right
now
at
the
stalemate
here
quite
palpable
jake

thanks
very
much
here
with
me
to
discuss
is
congressman
adam
smith
of
washington
state
he's
the
chairman
of
the
house
armed
services
committee
mr
chairman
thanks
for
joining
us
cnn
is
reporting
russia
said
they're
going
to
stop
sending
electricity
to
finland
as
of
tomorrow
they
say
it's
due
to
a
problem
in
receiving
payments
but
this
is
a
day
after
finland's
leaders
expressed
support
for
joining
nato
do
you
this
is
russia
retaliation
and
should
neighboring
countries
expect
to
see
more
of
it
from
russia
rep
adam
smith
d
wa
no
absolutely
we
have
seen
this
already
russia
has
cut
off
i
think
they
cut
off
poland
they're
trying
to
leverage
their
energy
sales
to
put
pressure
on
nato
countries
but
the
eu
nato
countries
like
finland
sweden
they
have
been
remarkably
resilient
in
resisting
that
pressure
and
finding
alternatives
and
working
with
partners
and
allies
to
fill
the
gaps
the
russians
are
leaving
but
yeah
no
question
this
is
retaliatory
step
and
a
step
to
try
to
stop
finland
from
being
from
wanting
to
join
nato
but
it
does
not
appear
to
be
working
it
appears
to
be
having
the
opposite
effect
it
lets
countries
like
finland
know
they
need
allies
they
can
rely
on
because
russia
is
going
to
continue
to
threaten
them
in
a
variety
of
ways
tapper
russian
forces
are
continuing
to
retreat
from
some
ukrainian
villages
in
the
kharkiv
region
do
you
think
there's
a
direct
line
between
the
growing
success
of
the
ukrainian
army
and
the
increased
aid
and
equipment
coming
from
the
u.s
and
some
other
western
countries
16

smith
there's
absolutely
no
doubt
about
it
it
has
been
a
united
effort
across
nato
and
a
number
of
other
allies
as
well
have
been
able
to
get
forces
in
i
spoke
with
the
chairman
of
the
ukraine
defense
committee
this
morning
and
he
was
incredibly
thankful
in
particular
for
the
howitzers
we
were
able
to
send
in
they
are
getting
ammunition
to
push
back
against
the
russians
and
to
take
advantage
of
the
russian
weaknesses
the
weaknesses
that
have
been
well
documented
in
their
supply
lines
and
morale
of
their
troops
it's
having
a
huge
difference
now
russia
is
still
they're
still
moving
in
particularly
down
south
around
kherson
but
the
support
that
has
been
given
to
the
ukrainians
and
the
incredible
will
they
have
to
fight
is
clearly
making
a
difference
tapper
earlier
this
week
the
house
passed
the
40
billion
aid
package
for
ukraine
it
was
expected
to
pass
the
senate
quickly
but
kentucky
senator
rand
paul
insisted
on
adding
a
provision
that
would
create
an
inspector
general
to
monitor
the
disbursement
of
the
40
billion
i
have
to
say
that
probably
doesn't
sound
all
that
unreasonable
to
a
lot
of
our
viewers
what's
the
problem
why
not
why
not
just
add
a
watchdog
to
oversee
40
billion
smith
well
we
are
going
to
add
watchdogs
the
problem
is
that
it
slows
down
the
passage
of
this
aid
because
the
house
passed
it
if
they
change
it
in
the
senate
then
we
will
have
to
pass
it
again
and
there
is
incredible
urgency
and
this
as
you
know
is
the
original
authority
the
president
has
had
is
running
out
is
gone
so
it's
a
procedural
issue
it's
a
matter
of
how
quickly
we
move
this
i
can't
speak
to
why
the
senate
didn't
resolve
it
earlier
why
senator
paul
didn't
bring
it
up
earlier
but
we
know
senator
paul
is
not
supportive
of
the
aid
itself
he's
not
supportive
of
a
lot
of
u.s
actions
in
the
world
so
while
this
offer
is
reasonable
it's
not
being
offered
just
for
that
it's
being
offered
to
try
to
slow
down
the
process
and
that's
what
the
senate
has
gotten
bogged
down
in
look
the
senate
is
an
impossible
body
to
work
in
i
have
enormous
sympathy
for
the
senators
i
work
with
one
person
can
mess
things
up
at
any
stage
in
the
process
but
understand
this
isn't
about
whether
or
not
we
have
an
inspector
general
this
is
about
how
quickly
we
actually
get
the
aid
out
there's
also
a
bipartisan
support
for
the
inspector
general
we
just
don't
want
to
stop
aid
from
getting
to
ukraine
while
we
figure
that
out
tapper
all
right
congressman
adam
smith
of

thanks
so
much
mr

appreciate
it
see

tapper
continuing
with
our
world
lead
today
one
of
the
many
challenges
facing
ukraine's
government
and
military
is
identifying
and
handling
the
bodies
of
russian
soldiers
who
have
been
killed
and
the
russian
military
has
left
behind
cnn's
sara
sidner
takes
a
look
at
how
they're
using
technology
both
to
help
with
this
difficult
task
and
help
advance
their
aims
in
the
propaganda
war
with
moscow
we
need
to
warn
you
of
course
some
of
the
images
in
this
report
you
may
find
disturbing

senior
national
correspondent
voice
over
inside
this
refrigerated
train
car
a
gruesome
sight
the
bodies
of
russian
soldiers
packed
and
stacked
for
storage
look
this
is
looted
every
russian
soldier
who
is
stored
here
as
a
dead
body
has
committed
a
crime
against
ukraine
he
says
storing
the
bodies
of
enemies
aligned
with
the
rules
of
war
set
out
by
the
geneva
convention
he
says
after
the
active
phase
of
combat
the
parties
must
exchange
the
bodies
of
dead
military
but
they
must
try
to
identify
the
dead
men
first
this
is
where
the
ministry
of
digital
transformation
comes
in
we
have
identified
about
300
cases
he
says
they
do
it
by
using
a
myriad
of
techniques
but
the
most
effective
has
been
facial
recognition
technology
they
upload
a
picture
of
a
face
the
technology
scrubs
all
the
social
networks
really
fast
once
they
have
a
match
they
go
one
step
further
we
send
messages
to
their
friends
and
relatives
these
are
often
gruesome
photos
of
dead
soldiers
why
do
you
send
them
to
the
families
in
russia
there
are
two
goals
one
is
to
show
the
russians
there's
a
real
war
going
on
here
to
fight
against
the
russian
propaganda
to
show
them
they're
not
as
strong
as
they're
shown
on
tv
and
russians
really
are
dying
here
the
second
goal
is
to
give
them
an
opportunity
to
pick
up
the
bodies
in
ukraine
they
do
get
responses
from
russian
families
they're
responding
basically
saying
you
will
be
killed
i
will
come
and
i
will
also
take
part
in
this
war
eighty
percent
of
the
families
answers
are
we'll
come
to
ukraine
ourselves
and
kill
you
and
you
deserve
what's
happening
to
you
what
about
that
20
percent
some
of
them
say
they're
grateful
and
they
know
about
the
situation
and
some
would
like
to
come
and
pick
up
the
body
the
technology
is
not
just
being
used
on
the
dead
it
is
also
being
used
to
identify
russian
soldiers
who
are
alive
some
of
whom
are
being
accused
of
war
crimes
we
have
established
the
identity
of
one
military
man
we
have
a
lot
of
materials
irrefutable
evidence
this
prosecutor
says
this
is
footage
of
the
russian
military
man
he's
talking
about

he
says
he
was
caught
on
video
in
belarus
trying
to
sell
items
he
had
looted
from
ukrainian
homes
but
his
alleged
crimes
go
far
beyond
that
the
soldier
is
accused
of
taking
part
in
the
execution
of
four
ukrainian
men
with
their
hands
bound
behind
their
backs
cnn
obtained
new
video
of
the
scene
just
before
shots
were
fired
you
can
see
what
appears
to
be
soldiers
standing
around
and
a
man
on
his
knees
on
the
ground
to
the
right
of
them
prosecutors
say
the
soldier
was
first
identified
by
the
technology
and
then
by
a
ukrainian
citizen
who
said
the
soldier
tortured
him
after
entering
his
home
we
showed
these
photos
to
the
witnesses
and
victims
they
identified
the
specific
person
who
was
among
other
russian
military
personnel
who
killed
four
people
in
this
particular
place
the
prosecutor
said
the
end
result
of
all
their
investigations
they
hope
will
be
a
full
record
of
what
happened
in
ukraine
and
the
proof
they
need
to
prosecute
those
who
committed
crimes
against
its
people

how
they
felt
about
sending
those
gruesome
photos
of
dead
soldiers
to
the
families
and
his
response
was
this
is
our
job
they
have
done
crimes
against
ukraine
and
frankly
they
made
the
choice
to
come
here
and
kill
us
this
is
our
job
this
is
our
duty
and
we'll
continue
to
do

what
about

of

but
29
states
now
report
more
people
in

hospital
with
covid
in
the
last
two
weeks
this
as
the
new

czar
warns
of
100
million
infections
this
fall
and

if
more
mitigation
efforts
do
not
happen
joining
us
to
discuss
president
biden's
chief
medical
adviser
and
director
of
the
national
institute
of
allergy
and
infectious
diseases
dr
anthony
fauci
dr
fauci
good
to
see
you
let's
start
with
this
warning
from
dr
jha
you
said
100
million
could
be
a
worst
case
scenario
but
you
know
the
lack
of
trust
that
people
have
these
days
the
public
versus
health
officials
and
the
government
et
cetera
why
not
have
the
white
house
release
the
modeling
behind
this
projection
to
help
convince
lawmakers
there
is
a
need
here
a
real
risk
dr
anthony
fauci
director
national
insitute
of
allergy
and
infectious
diseases
well
jake
it
isn't
a
question
of
releasing
the
models
models
really
vary
and
as
i
have
told
you
in
previous
interviews
the
model
is
only
as
good
as
the
assumptions
you
put
into
the
model
they
can
change
and
obviously
we're
dealing
with
a
fluid
and
dynamic
situation
with
the
cases
going
up
not
really
sure
what
the
variant
will
be
as
we
get
into
the
fall
so
it
really
was
an
estimate
and
those
estimates
are
soft
and
the
real
bottom
line
reason
for
it
was
to
just
make
sure
that
we're
prepared
for
the
possibility
that
we
will
see
that
degree
of
a
surge
where
you're
talking
about
100
million
cases
over
the
fall
and
winter
remember
when
omicron
hit
in
its
big
peak
about
30
percent
of
the
country
got
infected
that
was
a
really
big
surge
there
so
even
though
we're
not
sure
what's
going
to
happen
you
can
make
some
broad
estimates
tapper
there's
a
new
report
that
says
better
vaccination
rates
could
have
prevented
half
of
the
u.s
covid
deaths
since
the
vaccine
was
available
early
2021
only
66
percent
of
the
country
right
now
is
fully
vaccinated
meaning
about
a
third
of
the
country
is
not
even
fewer
americans
just
over
100
million
people
in
the
u.s
have
gotten
the
vaccine
and
a
booster
there's
not
one
state
in
the
united
states
that
has
reached
50
percent
mark
on
boosters
it
is
hard
to
argue
that
the
public
education
part
of
the
vaccine
campaign
has
completely
worked
yet
i
still
don't
see
evidence
that
the
government
is
using
creative
ways
to
reach
people
who
refuse
to
get
vaccinated
such
as
using
donald
trump's
words
about
how
the
vaccines
work
to
appeal
to
his
fans
why
not
fauci
you
know
i
can't
address
the
issue
of
whether
we
should
use
former
president
trump's
words
but
i
have
to
tell
you
jake
it
is
really
painful
as
a
scientist
a
physician
and
a
public
health
official
to
see
the
overwhelming
data
that
show
the
difference
between
vaccinated
versus
unvaccinated
and
boosted
when
it
comes
to
hospitalizations
and
deaths
we
really
have
tried
you
know
virtually
everything
i
mean
i'm
a
little
at
a
loss
for
what
further
we
can
do
when
you
have
this
disparity
of
morbidity
and
mortality
that's
staring
you
right
in
the
face
and
it's
amazing
we
have
1
million
deaths
and
you're
absolutely
right
the
estimates
vary
but
certainly
we
could
have
prevented
at
least
a
few
hundred
thousand
of
those
deaths
if
people
who
were
eligible
to
be
vaccinated
got
vaccinated
i
don't
have
any
really
smart
and
great
answers
for
how
we
can
do
better
but
i
would
just
wish
people
would
look
at
the
data
and
believe
the
data
16
45
02
it's
not
made
up
it's
real
tapper
yeah
i
know
you
don't
tweet
from
the
white
house
account
but
i
wanted
to
raise
this
because
amazingly
this
white
house
tweet
is
still
up
they
tweeted
it
yesterday
it
says
quote
when
president
biden
took
office
millions
were
unemployed
and
there
was
no
vaccine
available
and
it
goes
on
from
there
but
as
you
know
that's
not
true
there
was
vaccine
available
it
might
not
have
been
widely
available
but
it
was
available
cnn
fact
checker
daniel
dale
points
out
more
than
3
million
americans
had
been
fully
vaccinated
more
than
18
million
had
one
shot
by
inauguration
day
i
think
president
biden
then
president
elect
biden
had
two
shots
by
then
you're
the
president's
chief
medical
adviser
why
is
the
white
house
politicizing
the
pandemic
by
tweeting
out
there
was
no
vaccine
available
until
joe
biden
became
president
it's
not
true
fauci
you
know
jake
i'm
sorry
i
can't
explain
every
tweet
that
comes
out
so
you're
talking
to
the
wrong
person
i
wasn't
involved
in
the
tweet
i
can't
explain
it
sorry
tapper
but
i
know
you
can't
explain
it
but
certainly
you
would
agree
that
it's
important
to
have
facts
when
it
comes
to
assertions
being
made
about
the
vaccine
whether
it's
from
the
trump
white
house
or
the
biden
white
house
and
certainly
you
would
agree
that
there
was
vaccine
available
before
joe
biden
became
president
fauci
yeah
of
course
i
mean
he
got
vaccinated
and
others
got
vaccinated
so
i
mean
i
think
from
a
pure
accuracy
that's
not
a
correct
statement
but
i
mean
you
know
it
just
went
out
i'm
sorry
there's
nothing
i
could
do
about
that
jake
tapper
all
right
well
i
think
you
have
done
something
by
pointing
out
it's
inaccurate
dr
fauci
thank
you
so
much
have
a
good
weekend
really
appreciate
it
fauci
yeah

coming
up
israeli
police
beat

at
a
funeral
procession
for
a
palestinian

tapper
also
in
our
world
lead
today
more
flash
points
in
the
rising
violence
between
israelis
and
palestinians
an
israeli
soldier
was
killed
today
during
a
counterterrorism
raid
at
the
jenin
palestinian
refugee
camp
in
the
west
bank
the
palestinian
health
ministry
says
13
people
were
injured
there
this
comes
as
funeral
services
were
held
for
a
palestinian
american
al
jazeera
correspondent
shireen
abu
akleh
who
was
shot
and
killed
earlier
this
week
while
covering
another
israeli
military
operation
at
the
jenin
camp
an
investigation
into
who
killed
her
is
under
way
though
al
jazeera
blames
the
israeli
military
as
atika
shubert
shows
us
now
what
happened
at
today's
funeral
only
further
fueled
already
existing

from
strangers
and

alike
her
niece
lareen
abu
akleh
lareen
abu
akleh
niece
she
meant
everything
to
me
and
clearly
to
everyone
we
can
see
she
made
a
huge
impact
on
palestine
on
all
the
people
she
left
her
fingerprint
on
everyone's
heart
shubert
but
as
the
funeral
procession
began
israeli
riot
police
first
blocked
the
coffin
from
moving
forward
then
charged
hitting
several
pallbearers
with
batons
the
coffin
nearly
falling
to
the
ground
things
are
very
tense
here
the
funeral
procession
tried
to
walk
out
of
the
hospital
gates
israeli
police
did
not
allow
it
they
threw
in
tear
gas
had
flash
bombs
here
tried
to
disperse
the
crowds
and
now
it
appears
the
hearse
is
being
brought
here
to
try
to
bring
the
coffin
out
israeli
police
insist
they
acted
against
stone
throwing
by
mourners
providing
this
video
as
evidence
but
cnn
did
not
see
any
stones
but
did
witness
dozens
of
plastic
bottles
being
thrown
at
police
what
is
clear
is
that
israeli
police
ultimately
used
force
to
try
and
contain
this
outpouring
of
grief
and
anger
shireen
abu
akleh
was
beloved
by
palestinian
viewers
for
giving
them
a
voice
and
chronicling
their
struggle
born
and
raised
here
jerusalem
was
her
home
israeli
authorities
did
finally
permit
the
family
to
bring
her
coffin
to
the
church
by
car
thousands
of
mourners
were
also
ultimately
allowed
to
swell
the
streets
carrying
her
atop
a
river
of
grief
anger
and
defiance
to
her
final
resting
place
at
the
mt
zion
cemetery
even
at
her
own
funeral
it
seems
shireen
abu
akleh
gave
voice
to
the
struggles
and
frustrations
of
so
many
palestinians
end
videotape
shubert
on
camera
it
was
a
tremendous
outpouring
of
solidarity
jake
by
the
palestinian
community
this
was
really
the
biggest
palestinian
funeral
we
have
seen
in
east
jerusalem
since
the
death
of
one
of
the
biggest
anyway
since
the
death
of
yasser
arafat
in
2004
just
to
give
you
a
sense
of
how
beloved
she
was
all
of
the
different
denominations
of
the
christian
churches
in
the
old
city
rang
bells
for
her
funeral
that
is
an
unprecedented
thing
to
happen
for
a
funeral
here
in
jerusalem
