\noindent So much information about our political world is stored not in tidy datasets, but in \textit{texts}. Party manifestos, social media posts, city council minutes, email correspondence, treaties, ordinances, judicial decisions, presidential debates, Congressional speeches....the practice of politics in its myriad forms ultimately comes to be recorded in words on a page. How do we take all this unstructured text, far too extensive for any one researcher to read, and convert it into useful information for scientific inquiry?

In this class we will explore the cutting edge of ``text-as-data'', with a focus on how to retrieve, represent, and analyze political texts as part of a research project. We will aim to cover both the conceptual and the practical, spending class time writing code to replicate and extend significant results from the past decade of political science research.

\section*{Course Prerequisites and Objectives}
%\vskip.15in
%\noindent\textbf{Course Objectives:}  
I will assume that before taking this course you have taken the POLS 7012 and 7014 or their equivalents (introduction to statistics and linear regression) and that you are familiar with the \texttt{R} programming language. By the end of this course, you will be able to:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Retrieve and clean text data from a variety of sources
	\item Thoughtfully measure and quantify concepts of interest to your research using text data
	\item Fit machine learning models for clustering, sentiment analysis, topic classification, and prediction
\end{itemize}


\section*{Assignments \& Grading}

There will be daily coding activities in class designed to apply the concepts we learn to practical research problems. Your grade will be based on the successful completion of these assignments. 

%\vskip.15in
%\noindent\textbf{Office Hours:} 
\section*{Office Hours}

Since we're meeting for 3 hours every day, I will not hold formal office hours, but I will generally be available before and after class to discuss questions and will respond to emails from 9am to 4pm.

\section*{Textbooks}

For our tour through the world of text as data, we will rely on two textbooks. The first is a a broad conceptual overview of the field of text as data, and the second is a practical introduction to the \texttt{R} code you can use to work with text (and is available online for free at the link below).
