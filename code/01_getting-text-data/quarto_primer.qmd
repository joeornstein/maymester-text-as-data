## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

## Including R objects in the text

There are `r 2 + 3` apples in the room.

```{r}
my_sentence <- 'Hello this YET is another sentence.'
```

There are `r nchar(my_sentence)` characters in my sentence.

You can also embed figures like so:

```{r}
#| fig-cap: '1970s cars weight vs gas mileage'
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = mtcars,
       mapping = aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_classic()
```
